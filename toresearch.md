1. Terran United (Humans)
Legend: Pelé

The Fit: If humanity is fighting for its existence, we need the "King." Pelé provides the emotional heart and the "Joga Bonito" spirit required to keep a bunch of terrified humans believing they can beat aliens.

The Brief: He wears a special #10 kit that glows when the crowd roars.

2. Neon Soul FC (Androids)
Legend: Cristiano Ronaldo

The Fit: Known for his machine-like discipline, obsession with stats, and peak physical engineering. He doesn't just play for the Androids; he optimized their software.

The Brief: CR7 is the only human whose work rate matches a processor's clock speed. He leads the line with a "Siuuu" that vibrates at a frequency only robots can hear.

3. Red Sands Athletic (Martians)
Legend: Zlatan Ibrahimović

The Fit: Zlatan has often claimed he is not from this world. His acrobatic, gravity-defying taekwondo goals make him the perfect leader for a low-gravity Martian squad.

The Brief: He doesn't take orders from the Martian High Command; they take orders from him.

4. The Order XI (Jedi-inspired)
Legend: Lionel Messi

The Fit: Messi plays as if he can see the future. His balance, the way the ball "sticks" to him, and his "quiet genius" vibe are peak Jedi Master energy.

The Brief: He doesn't need a lightsaber; he has a left foot. He uses "The Flow" to glide through defenses without being touched.

5. Cylon Centurions (BSG Drones)
Legend: Roy Keane

The Fit: You need a leader who is colder and more ruthless than a toaster. Keane provides the relentless, uncompromising "Red Eye" intensity required to lead a mechanical army.

The Brief: If a Cylon misses a tackle, Keane’s stare will short-circuit their motherboard before the coach can.

6. Na’vi Blue Waves (Avatar-inspired)
Legend: Ronaldinho

The Fit: The Na'vi play with a deep connection to nature and pure joy. Ronaldinho, with his permanent smile and "magic" style, fits the bioluminescent, rhythmic vibe of Pandora perfectly.

The Brief: He leads the pre-game "Hometree" dance and performs "no-look" passes while swinging from the stadium rafters.

7. The Hive Mind (Xenomorph-style)
Legend: Luis Suárez

The Fit: Known for his "predatory" instincts and... well, a history of using his teeth in high-pressure moments. He fits the terrifying, relentless nature of the Hive Mind.

The Brief: He is the "Alpha Drone." He sniffs out a goal from 40 yards away and is completely unbothered by the acidic atmosphere.

8. The Vulcan Logic (Trek-inspired)
Legend: Kevin De Bruyne

The Fit: Often described as having a "GPS in his head," De Bruyne is the most logical player in history. He sees the pitch as a series of geometric equations.

The Brief: He never celebrates. He simply looks at his Vulcan teammates and says, "That assist was the most logical outcome."

9. The Bounty Hunters (Guild-inspired)
Legend: Diego Maradona

The Fit: A rebel, a rogue, and a man who played by his own rules. Maradona is the ultimate Bounty Hunter captain—using "The Hand of God" (or a smuggled thermal detonator) to get the win.

The Brief: He wears a tattered cape over his #10 jersey and carries the team through pure, chaotic willpower.

10. The Elders of Gallifrey (Time Lord-style)
Legend: Andrea Pirlo

The Fit: Pirlo played football at a different speed than everyone else. He was never hurried; it was like he could pause time, drink an espresso, and then find the pass.

The Brief: He wears a custom-tailored kit and controls the game like he’s lived through it 100 times already. “No pressure, no diamonds, just time.”
