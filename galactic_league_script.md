"The 3025 Battle of Football is proud to celebrate its 50th completion."

Wide shot of a shattered Earth from space. A massive holographic stadium ring orbits the planet. Text overlay: **"3025 AD"**.

**0:05 - 0:10**
**Audio:**
"Since the darkness fell in 2042, we’ve strived to push the boundaries of intergalactic football."

Montage of "The Darkness"—corrupted cities, neon lights flickering out, then reigniting in different colors across the galaxy. Fast cuts of strange alien crowds cheering.

"Pick your favorite... and cheer them to glory!"

A grid of 10 team logos flashing rapidly. The screen smashes to black. Silence for 1 second. Then the beat drops.

## Part 2: The Roster

### 1. Terran United (Humans)
**Audio:** "For the Home World... The King returns."
*   **Shot A:** A crumbling, vine-covered Maracanã Stadium. The crowd holds flares that form a giant "HOPE" sign.
*   **Shot B (Hero):** **Pelé**, wearing a glowing yellow kit, levitates slightly as he controls a ball made of pure light. He smiles—a beacon of warmth in the cold future.

### 2. Neon Soul FC (Androids)
**Audio:** "Perfection has a name. Optimization complete."
*   **Shot A:** A cyberpunk locker room. Cables disconnect from the backs of players' necks. Their eyes flicker on in unison.
*   **Shot B (Hero):** **Cristiano Ronaldo**, skin metallic and matte black, eyes glowing cyan. He does the "Siuuu" jump, and the shockwave shatters digital glass around him.
    *   *Reference:* `research/2_Neon_CR7/cr7_headshot.jpg`

### 3. Red Sands Athletic (Martians)
**Audio:** "Gravity cannot hold a God."
*   **Shot A:** The dust storms of Mars clearing to reveal a stadium carved into a red canyon. Low gravity means the goalposts are 20 feet high.
*   **Shot B (Hero):** **Zlatan Ibrahimović**, wearing rusty crimson armor. He executes a bicycle kick 15 feet in the air, looking down at the planet as if he owns it.

### 4. The Order XI (Jedi-Inspired)
**Audio:** "The Force flows through the ball."
*   **Shot A:** A floating temple stadium in the clouds. Silent monks watch from the stands.
*   **Shot B (Hero):** **Lionel Messi**, in flowing beige robes. He stands perfectly still, eyes closed. The ball orbits him telekinetically. He opens his eyes, and the ball launches forward at lightspeed.

### 5. Cylon Centurions (BSG Drones)
**Audio:** "Relentless. Unforgiving. Keane."
*   **Shot A:** A factory assembly line. Identical chrome robots march in formation onto a steel pitch.
*   **Shot B (Hero):** **Roy Keane**, half-man, half-machine. His red cybernetic eye scans the field. He points forward, and the army behind him charges.
    *   *Reference:* `research/5_Cylon_Keane/keane.jpg`

### 6. Na’vi Blue Waves (Avatar-Inspired)
**Audio:** "The rhythm of the wild."
*   **Shot A:** A bioluminescent jungle at night. The pitch is a giant glowing leaf.
*   **Shot B (Hero):** **Ronaldinho**, blue-skinned with stripes, swinging from a vine. He catches the ball on his chest with a massive grin, surrounded by floating spores.
    *   *Reference:* `research/6_Navi_Ronaldinho/ronaldinho.jpg`

### 7. The Hive Mind (Xenomorph-Style)
**Audio:** "The hunger never ends."
*   **Shot A:** A dark, slimy organic ship. The walls are breathing. The 'crowd' is a mass of eggs and screeching creatures.
*   **Shot B (Hero):** **Luis Suárez**, with an elongated, HR Giger-esque headpiece. He bares sharp teeth and sprints on all fours before striking the ball with lethal power.
    *   *Reference:* `research/7_Hive_Suarez/suarez.jpg`

### 8. The Vulcan Logic (Star Trek)
**Audio:** "Calculate. Execute. Win."
*   **Shot A:** A sterile, hexagonal geometric field floating in deep space. Mathematical formulas float in the air (HUD).
*   **Shot B (Hero):** **Kevin De Bruyne**, wearing a sleek, featureless grey uniform. He adjusts a holographic visor. He calculates a pass angle that bounces off three walls into the goal. "Logical."
    *   *Reference:* `research/8_Vulcan_KDB/kdb.png`

### 9. The Bounty Hunters (Star Wars/Mandalorian)
**Audio:** "No rules. Just credits."
*   **Shot A:** A wretched hive of scum and villainy—a cantina bar that overlooks a dirt pitch. Aliens gamble on the match.
*   **Shot B (Hero):** **Diego Maradona**, wearing a tattered cape and a blaster holster (with a ball in it). He cheats (uses his hand) but winks at the camera as he runs away with the trophy.
    *   *Reference:* `research/9_Bounty_Maradona/maradona.jpg`

### 10. The Elders of Gallifrey (Time Lords)
**Audio:** "Time is the ultimate playmaker."
*   **Shot A:** A stadium inside a clock face that is spinning backwards. The grass ages and regrows in seconds.
*   **Shot B (Hero):** **Andrea Pirlo**, sipping wine from a goblet. The ball is frozen in mid-air in front of him. He puts the glass down, steps forward, and casually chips the ball. It travels through a wormhole into the net.
